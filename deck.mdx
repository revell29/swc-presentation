# Why SWC so faster more than Babel?

---

<p>
  JavaScript is single-threaded and it would be impossible to run heavy
  <br />
  computations in an asynchronous way in a real-life application.
</p>

# Comparison with Single Core CPU

import Compare1 from "./components/Compare1";

<Compare1 />

---

# Comparison with <code>`Promise.all()`</code>

## 8 cores CPU and asynchronous

---

## The first experiment ran with 4 promises:

import Compare2 from "./components/Compare2";

<Compare2 />

---

## The second experiment ran with 100 promises:

import Compare3 from "./components/Compare3";

<Compare3 />

# SWC On real world application

import ImageCp from "./components/ImageCp";

<ImageCp image={JbPos} />
